The Happiness Report project is an analytical tool designed to evaluate and visualize global happiness data. The project leverages two advanced clustering techniques: ACP (Principal Component Analysis) combined with K-Means and CAH (Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering). These methods allow for the identification of patterns and groupings within large datasets, facilitating the understanding of relationships between key happiness indicators such as GDP, social support, life expectancy, and more. By applying ACP for dimensionality reduction and K-Means for clustering, followed by CAH for hierarchical analysis, the project provides insightful visualizations of the happiness distribution across different countries or regions. This approach helps reveal underlying trends and correlations, making the complex data more interpretable and actionable.
